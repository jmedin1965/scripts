scripts - a collection of scripts for /usr/local/scripts
========================================================

Just a collection of scripts I keep re-cerating or copying arround on my ubuntu linux machines.
This is my first attempt at managing this via a github repository.

This is a work in progress. If any scripts are usefull, please feel free to use them. If you want to change any, please let me know or create a pull request.

How to connect/install
----------------------

I like to install scripts at /usr/local. To do this, do the following;

cd /usr/local
git clone <https://jmedin1965@github.com/jmedin1965/scripts>

If you want the lfs-binaries, then download the git-lfs binary and

cd scripts
git-lfs install
git-lfs pull
